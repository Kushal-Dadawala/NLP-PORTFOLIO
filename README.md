## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1. **Named Entity Recognition using BiLSTM**
- Implements a **Bidirectional LSTM** model to identify and classify named entities (like people, locations, and organizations) from text.
- Uses **sequence labeling** and **word embeddings** for better context understanding.
- Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NLTK, NumPy

### 2. **Automated Lecture Transcriber and Summarizer**
- Converts spoken lectures into text using **speech-to-text (STT)** models.
- Summarizes long transcripts using **text summarization algorithms**.
- Technologies: Whisper / SpeechRecognition, Hugging Face Transformers, Python

### 3. **Online NLP-Based Interviewer**
- A virtual interviewer that asks and analyzes responses using NLP techniques.
- Detects **sentiment**, **keyword relevance**, and **fluency** in responses.
- Technologies: Transformers, spaCy, Streamlit
