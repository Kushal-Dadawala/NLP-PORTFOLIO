                <h3 class="card-title">What the Course Is About</h3>
                <p>
                    The course Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on teaching how computers can understand, process, and generate human language. 
                    It bridges concepts from computer science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence to create intelligent systems capable of reading, 
                    interpreting, and responding to human communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the course, I was introduced to a wide range of language processing techniques — starting from word-level text analysis 
                    to advanced transformer-based architectures like BERT and RoBERTa. The course emphasized both theoretical understanding and hands-on 
                    implementation using real-world datasets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This subject developed my ability to analyze textual data and build AI models that perform machine translation, summarization, 
                    question answering, sentiment analysis, and chatbot development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By completing this course, I not only understood the linguistic structure and semantics of language but also learned how to apply 
                    machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve natural language tasks efficiently.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-card">
                <h3 class="card-title">Course Details</h3>
                <p>
                    This course is about understanding how natural language data is represented and processed by computers. It involves studying grammar, 
                    syntax, and semantics, and using statistical and deep learning techniques to model language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students explore both classical NLP methods (like parsing and TF-IDF) and modern approaches (like word embeddings and transformers). 
                    The course also demonstrates how NLP powers many of today's AI applications such as voice assistants, automated translation systems, 
                    and intelligent chatbots.

                                <h4>Automated Lecture Transcriber and Summarizer</h4>
                                <p>Built an NLP-based system that automatically converts spoken lectures into text using speech-to-text models and then summarizes the content into concise notes. The project demonstrates integration of ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) with text summarization models to improve accessibility and productivity for students and educators.</p>
